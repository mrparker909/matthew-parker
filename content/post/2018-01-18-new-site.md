This site is a work in progress, with plenty of content to be added in the coming months. Thank you to [Andriy Koval](https://github.com/andkov) from the Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health for all of his help and support in getting this site setup and off the ground. 

Future topics will vary widely, and should encompass everything from tutorials, data analysis, exploration of R packages, commentary, and anything else that seems relevant to me at the time.
